Description: Extraclassical field effects are used to understand the paradigm
    under which the brain extracts information. Necessary and sufficient 
    conditions for these extraclassical effects (both with respect to natural 
    data and the rules of inference) are therefore an important step towards a 
    better understanding of the brain. This package both explains mathematical
    models of these effects and assists in their development.
